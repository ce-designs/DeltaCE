DeltaCE
=======

A Arduino library for controlling the DeltaCE relay attenuator

=======

This library provides the following function for controlling the DeltaCE relay attenuator:



The DeltaCE relay attenuator is based on the The d1 Relay-based R-2R Stereo Attenuator from AMB Laboratories. All credits for the design go to AMB audio

http://www.amb.org/audio/delta1/

The DeltaCE library is completely written by CE-Designs and is fully tested with de DeltaCE relay attenuator



It might even work work with the original d1 Relay-based R-2R Stereo Attenuator from AMB Laboratories, but this has not been tested. Feel free to test this, use and/or modify the code for your own needs.
